/**
 * \file MP3Shield_Library_Demo.ino
 *
 * \brief Example sketch of using the MP3Shield Arduino driver, demonstrating all methods and functions.
 * \remarks comments are implemented with Doxygen Markdown format
 *
 * \author Bill Porter
 * \author Michael P. Flaga
 *
 * This sketch listens for commands from a serial terminal (like the Serial
 * Monitor in the Arduino IDE). If it sees 1-9 it will try to play an MP3 file
 * named track00x.mp3 where x is a number from 1 to 9. For eaxmple, pressing
 * 2 will play 'track002.mp3'. A lowe case 's' will stop playing the mp3.
 * 'f' will play an MP3 by calling it by it's filename as opposed to a track
 * number.
 *
 * Sketch assumes you have MP3 files with filenames like "track001.mp3",
 * "track002.mp3", etc on an SD card loaded into the shield.
